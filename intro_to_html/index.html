    <h1>Basset Hounds Were Bred for Hunting</h1>
    <p>Basset Hounds were originally bred in France and Belgium. Basset is French for 'low.' It is thought Basset Hounds originated from crossing strains of older French breeds to create a low-built scenting hound to help track rabbit and deer for hunters. Their accuracy and persistence on scent made Bassets a popular choice for French aristocrats, for whom hunting was a way of life.</p>
