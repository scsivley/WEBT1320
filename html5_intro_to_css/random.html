       <h1>Mount Everest Base Camps</h1>
       <p>There are two base camps on Mount Everest on opposite sides of the mountains.  The South Base Camp is in Nepal at an altitude of 17,598 ft (5,364 meters), while North Base Camp is in China at 16,900 ft (5,150 meters).  The base camps are simple campsites at the base of Mount Everest that are used by mountain climbers during their ascent and descent. Climbers typically rest at base camp for several days for acclimatization to reduce the risk of altitude sickness.</p>

        <h2>Other Camps</h2>
        <p>Mountain climbers also utilize various other camps for the ascent in addition to the base camp.  Climbers temporarily stay in each of these camps to rest and acclimate on their trek to the summit.  There are a total of five camps along Everestâ€™s South Ridge, and four camps on the North Ridge.</p>

        <h3>South Base Camp Trek</h3>
        <p>Every year, about 40,000 people trek to the South Base Camp. So, while you might think of the summit when you think about trekkers, very few actually do.  Only 4,000 people have successfully summited Everest, with around 800 people a year even attempting it.</p>
