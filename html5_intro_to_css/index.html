        <p>Mount Everest is the highest point on Earth. It is about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) high.  The air at that height is thin, the temperatures are very cold, and the winds are extraordinarily strong.  The peak is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet. In Tibet, the peak is known as Chomolungma, or Qomolangma, meaning “Goddess Mother of the World.” </p>

        <h2>Climbing Mount Everest</h2>
        <p>Mount Everest has long been a challenge to mountaineers. Early attempts to reach the summit began in the 1920s. They failed largely because of the harsh conditions on the mountain. The first successful climb was in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepalese Sherpa guide.  Since then, there have been several successful climbs.</p>

        <h3>Sherpas</h3>
        <p>The best known of the Tibetan-speaking peoples that live in the valleys below the mountain are the Sherpas.  They live in villages at altitudes up to 14,000 feet.  Since they are well known for their strength and endurance at high altitudes, they are enlisted to lead many of the climbing trips in the Himalayas.</p>
