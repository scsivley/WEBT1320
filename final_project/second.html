                <h2>Patrick Mahomes #15</h2>
                <p>Patrick entered his seventh season with the Chiefs in 2023 and his sixth-year as the starter (2018-23).
                   He is the youngest player ever to win both a league MVP and a Super Bowl title.
                   He is the first player in the 21st century to win both the league MVP and the Super Bowl MVP in the same season (2022).
                   He entered the NFL as a first-round pick (10th overall) by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL Draft.
                   The Chiefs traded the No. 27 overall pick, a third-round pick and their 2018 first-round selection to the Buffalo Bills in order to move up to the 10th spot to select Mahomes.</p>
