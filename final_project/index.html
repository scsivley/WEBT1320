            <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team, based in Kansas City, Missouri.  They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West Division.
            The team was founded in 1959 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt, and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL).  In spring 1963, the team relocated to Kansas City and assumed its current name.  
            The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.  Despite post-season success early in the franchise's history, winning five of their first six postseason games, the team struggled to find success in the playoffs for decades, 
            losing ten of eleven playoff games from 1993 to 2017.  Since then, the Chiefs have risen to dynastic performance under head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and tight end Travis Kelce, appearing in three Super Bowls since 2019 and winning two, LIV and LVII.</p>
